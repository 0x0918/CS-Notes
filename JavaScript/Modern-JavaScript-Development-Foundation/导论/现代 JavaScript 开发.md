# 现代 JavaScript 开发

# ECMAScript 的过去、现在与未来

WTF is ECMAScript?

Here’s what happened long, long ago:

JavaScript was originally named JavaScript in hopes of capitalizing on the success of Java.

Netscape then submitted JavaScript to ECMA International for Standardization. (ECMA is an organization that standardizes information)

This results in a new language standard, known as ECMAScript.

Put simply, ECMAScript is a standard. While JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard. JavaScript implements ECMAScript and builds on top of it.

Okay, so ‘ES’…?

ES is simply short for ECMAScript. Every time you see ES followed by a number, it is referencing an edition of ECMAScript. In fact, there are eight editions of ECMAScript published. Lets dive into them:

ES1, ES2, ES3, ES4

ES1: June 1997 — ES2: June 1998 — ES3: Dec. 1999 — ES4: Abandoned

I’ve grouped all of these together. These were the first 4 editions of ECMAScript, and to save time, we wont go too in-depth. Just know that the first three editions were annual, and the fourth was abandoned due to political differences.

ES5

December 2009: Nearly 10 years later, ES5 was released in 2009. It would then take almost six years for the next version of ECMAScript to be released.

ES6 / ES2015

June 2015: Perhaps the cause for all of your confusion begins here. You see, ES6 and ES2015 are the same thing.

ES6 was the popularized name prior to release. However, the committee that oversees ECMAScript specifications made the decision to move to annual updates. With this change, the edition was renamed to ES 2015 to reflect the year of release. Subsequent releases will therefor also be named according to the year they are released.

ES2016 (ES7)

June 2016: Seventh edition of ECMAScript.

ES2017 (ES8)

June 2017: Eighth edition of ECMAScript.

ES.Next

You may have also seen ES.Next used online. This term is dynamic and references the next version of ECMAScript coming out.

Why?

Each release brings updates and new features to the language.

Key Takeaways:

An update to ECMAscript can be expected annually.

Initial Editions of ECMAScript are named numerically, increasing by 1: ES1, ES2, ES3, ES4, ES5

New editions (starting with 2015) will be named ES followed by the year of release: ES2015, ES2016, ES2017

ECMAScript is a standard. JavaScript is the most popular implementation of that standard. Other implementations include: SpiderMonkey, V8, and ActionScript.

模块化无疑是 ES6 中最令人激动的特性，保证了大型应用程序的健壮性、可扩展性与可重构性

# 引擎与运行时：代码解析与执行

JavaScript 是典型的解释型语言，其需要运行在某个容器内：该容器首先将 JavaScript 代码转化为可执行的命令（语法解析以及 JIT），然后注入某些全局变量以允许 JavaScript 与外部进行交互。所谓的 JavaScript 引擎（Engine ）就是负责解析与编译，将 JavaScript 脚本转化为机器理解的命令；而 JavaScript 运行时（Runtime ）这是提供了程序运行期间能够访问的内建库。譬如在浏览器中运行的代码，能够访问 Window 对象或者 DOM API，其就是由浏览器的 JavaScript 运行时提供的。而 Node.js 提供的运行时则包含了不同的库，譬如 Cluster 或者文件系统接口等等。所有的运行时都会包含基础的数据类型以及常见的 Console 对象这样的工具库。我们可以认为 Chrome 与 Node.js 共用相同的 Google V8 引擎，而拥有不同的运行时。
