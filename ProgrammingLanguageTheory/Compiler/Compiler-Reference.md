- [From math to machine: translating a function to machine code](http://6me.us/7BlocZ): In this post I'm going to explore how a mathematical concept can be redefined in progressively more computer-oriented terms, all the way from high level languages down to machine code, ready for direct execution by a computer.

# JIT

- [2017-Monads to Machine Code](http://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/monads_machine_code.html): Let’s build a small LLVM-like intermediate language and JIT execution engine in Haskell. 

- [Adventures in JIT compilation【Series】](https://parg.co/bs2): he plan is to take a simple input language and develop some interpreters and JITs for it, in roughtly increasing degree of complexity.
